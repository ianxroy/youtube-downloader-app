# **App Name**: HanBeats

## Core Features:

- URL Input: Paste a YouTube link into the designated field.
- URL Parsing: Parse the URL to extract video information.
- Format Selection: Retrieve available download options from the YouTube video, including MP3 and MP4 formats, as well as resolutions.
- Download Option Selection: Allow the user to choose the desired format (MP3 or MP4) and resolution.
- Format Conversion: Implement background processing to handle the video conversion to MP3 or MP4 using a tool and/or other steps. This task must be robust to network interruptions.
- Ad Integration: Display non-intrusive ads without compromising the user experience.
- Download Trigger: Provide a download button that triggers the file download after conversion is complete. Show progress during conversion and transmission. Do not interrupt background processing for an in-page ad.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#D633FF) to capture attention. In hexcode, this value represents 84% red, 20% green, and 100% blue. The vibe is eye-catching.
- Background color: Black
- Accent color: Saturated purple (#D633FF) to capture attention.
- Font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif that complements the modern, clean aesthetic of the app. The goal is to make a readable and neutral interface. Poppins will be used for both body and headers, as the sections are short and this treatment will contribute to a more modern look.
- Use GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth, subtle animations. These will be incorporated to create transitions and hover effects, providing an interactive feel to button states and throughout the UI.
